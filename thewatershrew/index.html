A tale of waterside life across the ages</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Chapter 1: From one time to another</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;Hello, dear reader! How do you do? My name is Astra, but everybody calls me Rat. I will introduce myself by telling you that I am a humble, meditative, and solitary but not unfriendly (or so I like to think) rat, living in a pleasant burrow in a garden bank sloping down to the River Thames at Maidenhead. I am not the real subject of these stories, so you do not need to know much more about me, except that<br />
I always feel a real pang of pleasure whenever I receive a visit from my friend Sam, the water shrew, who is indeed the hero of all these adventures.<br />
This tale, the first in a long and absorbing series, begins in the year 1844, in the latter days of what should have been the merry month of May. In the garden where my burrow began, it was merry enough, all was well, trees were in leaf, birds sang, and skies were blue. In London, however, further down the Thames, the atmosphere was less pleasant.<br />
One morning, I was sitting, as I often do, with my nose and whiskers just protruding from my burrow, enjoying the sun without exposing myself more than necessary, when I heard a hum that I knew well. I felt that pang of pleasure! I darted out of my burrow (I am stout but agile when inspired), glanced up the bank, and saw the flash of blue for which I had hoped. It was Sam! arriving in his little blue car.<br />
When I say &quot;little&quot;, I do mean &quot;little&quot;. Water shrews are smaller than mice, and Sam&rsquo;s car was not very much bigger than he was. He could park it in the long grass and feel sure no one could see it unless they came very close. That is why I always saw it approaching only in a flash of blue, glimpsed between waving grass stems.<br />
Sam climbed out, greeted me, and coughed. He coughed a great deal. Then he asked me if I had a damp cleaning cloth. He wanted to clean his car. It had a thin layer of black dust on it. I had to admit that its blue was less vivid, less kingfisher-like, than usual.<br />
Sam lived, like me, in a riverside garden, by a sweet little brook leading to the Thames. He had a wonderful network of tunnels, with many chambers and many exits, most near the river. But, he told me; he could no longer bear to go into the river. It was TOO SMELLY AND BROWN AND DISGUSTING. The inhabitants of London were in the unfortunate habit of dumping all their poo and other rubbish into their rivers, and as more and more people and factories moved to London, more and more filth was choking the Thames and its tributaries. There was, at the moment, less water than usual because it had not rained much; there was less wind than usual; there was more heat than usual (the weather had been warm for a week); and the result was a DREADFUL STINK rising from the thick, sluggish, murky river water. Furthermore, all the fish in the river were dying, and little fish were Sam&rsquo;s favourite food. What was a poor shrew to do?<br />
I sympathised and was privately glad to live upriver and generally upwind from the STINK. Of course, I invited Sam to spend the summer months in my garden. But he was not happy with this proposition, though he did thank me for my kindness. Like all true water shrews, he loved his home, with its tunnel network lovingly developed over the years. To leave it would have felt like a betrayal of his true self. Furthermore, again like all true water shrews, he was easily agitated, and when a problem raised itself, he wanted to attack it directly, not avoid it. He did not want to move away from his London garden; he wanted to rid his garden of the STINK.<br />
How? you might wonder. How could one small water shrew with a little blue car get rid of a STINK made by millions of enormous stinky human Londoners?<br />
The answer lay in his car&rsquo;s other function. It was not only a car that could travel from place to place. It was also a car that could travel from time to time. From one time to another.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Chapter 2: Looking both ways</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re an old rat, and you&#39;ve lived by the Thames all your life,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I have,&quot; I replied, &quot;and my parents and grandparents before me.&quot; Many people have a false idea that we rats are great travellers. Rats have indeed travelled all over the globe. But this is because humans carry us around, in their ships and wagons. By nature, we prefer not to wander far from our burrows and dens, and we are not great ones for walking long distances. My great-grandparents were resting in a haybale in Rickmansworth when they found themselves hoisted onto a cart with the bale, and transported to Maidenhead. They had no courage to walk back to their former home. So they made themselves a burrow, not fifty yards from where the bale was unloaded, and that is where I live today. Sam was, as I have said, similarly attached to his own riverside home. He was, however, very unlike a rat in that he was also fond of adventures; and I could see from the dangerous spark in his eye that he felt impelled to embark on one now. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;has the stink been steadily growing over the years, or does it come and go?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have heard&rdquo;, said I, &ldquo;that to some extent it comes and goes with the seasons, being at its worst in the summer, and when the river is low; but gradually, over the years, it is getting worse, as humans in London become more numerous and their factories more smelly. My rat friends who live in London expect it to increase continually. They are not entirely unhappy with this, for the stink nourishes many insects, upon which they feed, and indeed the stink partly proceeds from food that the humans throw out, on which they also feed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, rats may not mind it, but I hate it, and am determined to find out when it will end,&rdquo; Sam stated firmly. &ldquo;Surely, stupid though they are, the humans of London will sooner or later realise that they have to put a stop to it. How long do you think it will take them? Fifty years?&rdquo; I was less optimistic than Sam. Rats have a low opinion of human intelligence. They think of humans as cunning and crafty, but poor strategists and unable to see far ahead. A rat can always outwit a human by patience and planning. But this was not the time to tell Sam this. He was already in his car, strapping to his head a strange band of cloth which I had seen him use before. It seemed, somehow, to control the car&rsquo;s movements; not in space, but in time. I had no understanding of the mechanism involved; all I knew was what I had observed, and the little Sam had told me.<br />
A thought struck me, and I put it to Sam. &ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; I said, &quot;this remarkable vehicle in which you ride ... surely it must itself come from the future, from a distant future, for nothing like it can be made in our time. I can only suppose that you must have been to that future to fetch it. In that case, have you not seen what the future is like, and how it smells?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your deduction, dear rat, is not sound,&rdquo; Sam replied. &ldquo;It is true that this car comes from a distant future. But what makes you think that I went to that time to fetch it, rather than someone else bringing it here, for me, from its future?&rdquo; I had to admit that was indeed, rationally speaking, a possibility, though I could not help wondering who might have brought it. While I was asking myself whether it would be impolite to ask, Sam was saying: &ldquo;Well, off I go, to 1894! When should I return? Would tea-time today suit?&rdquo; &ldquo;That would be splendid,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I like nothing better than some good stories over tea. Could we make it about seven o&rsquo;clock, as the sun begins to go down? The humans in the house beyond my garden never venture forth at that time; they are always dining themselves. So I can set a table on the grass by the river, and we can sit outside while you tell me your tales of 1894.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall look forward to it,&quot; said Sam. Then he chuckled. &quot;Although shortly, strictly speaking, I shall be looking backwards to it. Fifty years back.&quot; He shut the door of his car. He appeared to close his eyes and touch his headband. The car seemed to shimmer slightly. It hummed. It whirred, I thought, like a bee&#39;s wings. Then it became difficult to see clearly &ndash; like a bee&#39;s wings; and gradually, it was gone. It had not moved, and yet it was gone.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Chapter 3: In the air</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;I spent a contented and busy day, preparing tea for Sam and myself. Another little-known fact about rats is that we are quite adept fishermen. I caught some fine minnows and sticklebacks and placed them carefully in a small pond near my burrow so that they would be fresh for Sam on his return. I made some cucumber sandwiches, and roasted some dandelion root, for coffee. I baked some dainty scones, set the table with a fine cloth inherited from my mother, and waited.<br />
I heard the dinner-gong from the house at the top of the garden. The sun was beginning to set. I was sure Sam was about to return. I turned my head and looked at the space where his car had been. Sure enough, just as my eyes reached it, the spot shimmered, like the air above a fire; then it became thick with a whirr of colours which settled to a fine blue, and there was the car. But it was not as blue as it had been.<br />
I walked up to it. Sam had not emerged. I remembered that on his arrival in the morning, the car had been covered with a fine layer of black dust, which Sam had been eager to remove, to return his car to its native glossy brilliance. Now, however, it was worse. There was black soot on the roof, and patches of stickiness on the sides. I wondered what fires he had had to traverse.<br />
The door opened, and Sam emerged, coughing. The expression on his face was as irritated as his lungs.<br />
&quot;Welcome back, Sam,&quot; I said. &quot;I suspect you are pleased to find yourself in the pleasant air of my green riverside garden.&quot; &quot;How right you are,&quot; replied Sam, in a voice that had a grating quality, like a rough stone being rubbed along a wall. He coughed again. &quot;So 1894 was indeed stinkier than 1844, I suppose, and London was bigger.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me a moment and fetch me some clean water,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and I will tell you the story. It is not quite what you expect.&rdquo;<br />
I fetched him a jug of water. He drank it and asked for more. With the second jug, he began cleaning his car. But it was not as easy as it had been in the morning. Some of the soot was reluctant to leave the car&#39;s paintwork. It stuck like glue. Sam sighed. Then he spied the table, set and ready. He walked over, sat down, and helped himself to a cucumber sandwich.<br />
I joined him. I did not speak; I wished to give him time to recover his spirits. As the river before us grew dark, he began to tell his tale. Here it is. He told it with many pauses, sighs, and increasing animation.<br />
&quot;I arrived in Maidenhead in 1894. You will be pleased to know, Rat, that your garden was still there, and your burrow. I wasted no time, however. I set out in my car for the middle of the river. Then I flew up in the air and darted like a kingfisher along the river towards London.<br />
The weather in Maidenhead was fine enough; much like today, though with an enervating absence of wind. But as I got closer to London, I found myself flying into a curious kind of greyish-yellow fog. It smelled, acrid, smoky, disagreeable. I began to cough. I tried flying closer to the river. That hardly helped. The fog was only a little less dense at river level. I did notice that the STINK was less apparent than in 1844. The river did seem a little less brown and foul; the occasional fish was to be seen in it. I should have rejoiced at this. But the fog was so depressing, I could not feel pleased.<br />
Going low had not enabled me to escape the fog, so I went high instead. I found it was possible to fly above the fog; that is where the gulls and pigeons flew. But the whole of central London was covered in it. The reason for the fog&#39;s repulsive colour and the smell was soon apparent. All over London were chimneys, far more than today. And these chimneys were belching out foul black smoke. The smoke, in the absence of wind, hung low over the city, leaving an acrid smell in the air, and black dust over everything. It was revolting.<br />
Having said that, from high in the air, London in 1894 was an impressive sight. As well as the tall chimneys, many impressive buildings could be seen rising through the fog. Church towers, factories, tall houses of all kinds, and a new bridge across the river which ran between two magnificent square towers. It seemed to have two levels, I am not sure why. There were, in fact, many new bridges, most, it seemed, for railways ... have you ever seen a railway, Rat?&rdquo;<br />
I had not. Sam explained about railways to me, and I pointed out that the locomotives must also be contributing to the smoke in the fog. He agreed. Then I ventured to ask him why he thought the stink in the river had diminished, given that, going by his description, the population of London must have increased. He was kind enough to say it was an excellent question &ndash; and he had the answer.<br />
&ldquo;Sewers, Rat, sewers.&rdquo;<br />
I did not know what a sewer was, nor how they had helped. Sam explained.<br />
&ldquo;I wanted to see whether my old home was still there. Well, you haven&rsquo;t visited it, Rat, so I had better describe it to you. It is beside a small river called the Effra, in South London. The Effra flows into the Thames only a mile or two downstream from my home. I found the spot (there is a tall and recognisable church spire near where I live) and flew down to it. The house and the garden were still there &ndash; and the Effra was less stinky! But looking down the river, I saw it vanished into a tunnel, not far from my garden. I followed it into the tunnel and was utterly astonished by what I found, as well as glad to escape.<br />
The humans, Rat, have diverted most of the small rivers in London, including the Effra, into a vast system of underground tunnels, great water-pipes, into which they also send all their wee, poo, and other rubbish, as well as the rainwater from the streets. It is no longer dumped straight into the Thames; that is why the Thames is less stinky. Instead, the water from the Effra and the other little rivers is used to flush the stinky stuff along the great pipes by the river, and it is only released into the Thames below London. At least I think that is what happens to it; I did not go to check. These pipes are called sewers. The result is that the water in London is cleaner. But the charming little rivers that used to flow into the Thames now all vanish into the sewers, where they are used to clean out the humans&#39; waste.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Tell me, Sam, is it possible for a rat to go into the sewers and find a place to rest?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and many do. It is a good place for rats. There are rarely any humans and plenty of ways in and out. It is, I expect, not too cold in winter, nor too hot in summer. There are neither cats nor dogs nor yet herons or gulls. The rats of London appreciate the sewer system.&quot;<br />
We pondered for a while, as the stars came out, and an owl hooted &ndash; not too near, fortunately. There was a gentle breeze. I told Sam about the little fish I had reserved for him. He darted off and came back in a better mood. He thanked me most graciously.<br />
&ldquo;Well&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;it seems that in 1894, one kind of stink will have been replaced by another. The stink in the river will have reduced. But the stink in the air will provide a nuisance just as annoying and unhealthy. Perhaps in 1944, both stinks will have been vanquished?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I shall go and see,&rdquo; said Sam.<br />
&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; I asked.<br />
&ldquo;No, not now,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I am going home. I want to clean my car properly. But, Rat, could I come back tomorrow at the same time, and tell you what I found in 1944?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; I said, eagerly. &ldquo;Would you like the same kind of tea?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what makes it worth coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Chapter 4: Escaping from a Doodlebug</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;After tea, off Sam went. He drove through the grass towards the river, his car making a pleasant humming sound like a honeybee in a happy mood. When he got to the water&rsquo;s edge, his car skimmed the surface of the water, then rose above it. In the darkness, it was hardly visible; but I could see it as a small almost black patch, moving over a river that glistened in the starlight. I watched as it headed out to the middle of the river, then flew downstream towards London.<br />
The next day felt slower than the previous one. I had all day to prepare the evening meal. Remembering how Sam had enjoyed the fish, I went fishing again; the river was pleasantly cool and clear, the fish remarkably co-operative, so I caught enough for both of us, plus a few to make into fishpaste for another day. Having time on my hands, I made sponge cakes rather than scones, and cress sandwiches. Then, about an hour before Sam was expected to arrive, I made myself a cool cucumber cocktail, and settled on my deckchair by the river, looking forward to a rest accompanied by reminiscences. I like to devote some time each day to remember my youth and young adulthood; it brings back my dear parents and siblings. I must have a vivid imagination, I suppose. When I am daydreaming by my burrow, I do seem to see them, as they were years ago, before my eyes.<br />
I was just chuckling at the sight of my father spanking my older brother for digging an escape tunnel that had flooded our nest-chamber (this had happened when we were both young scamps), when suddenly, and well before the dinner gong, the image before my eyes popped like a bubble. Sam&rsquo;s car had appeared! not with its usual shimmer, but with something like a dull flash (if that is possible). It dropped into the water. It swam towards the bank and drove up onto the grass, but further from my burrow than usual. I darted towards it. I felt sure something was wrong. Sam had never before appeared in such an undisciplined manner.<br />
As I reached the car, Sam opened the door, climbed out, and coughed in an even more rasping way than the previous day. His car had patches of whitish dust on the roof, though its lower parts had been washed by the river water. Sam himself was looking beige rather than grey as usual, due to the dust on his fur, and inside the car there seemed to be not only dust but some small pieces of brick.<br />
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;If 1894 was the year of coal dust, it seems that 1944 was the year of ... something worse!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; croaked Sam.<br />
I fetched him, not only water but the rest of my cucumber cocktail. He drank both, coughed some more, and then scampered off to the river for a swim.<br />
When he came back, he was back to his usual colour and had ceased coughing. &quot;Am I early?&quot; he asked. &quot;I had to leave in a hurry, and I was in such a paroxysm of coughing that I couldn&#39;t put my headband on, so I couldn&#39;t do the fine controls at the last minute.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;A little earlier than expected,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but no less welcome for that. I strongly suspect you will have a fine tale to tell me. Come and sit down, have another cocktail, and as soon as the gong goes in the house, I will bring out the table and we will eat.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Rat,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;you are a good chap to return to after a bracing adventure. Now here is my story.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Sam&rsquo;s Tale of 1944</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;I left my home in the late morning, after cleaning my car carefully, inside and out. I set my destination for one hundred years in the future; well, one hundred years and one month to be precise because I felt like some warmer weather. So I landed in late June 1944.<br />
I had started my journey in time from about fifty yards above the Effra. When I arrived, in the same place but at a different time, the first thing I did was to open my window and breathe in, to see whether there was a stink or a nasty fog. There was neither. The sewers still seemed to be working; the Thames was not emitting a foul pong. And there was no smog. There was quite a fresh wind and few clouds in the sky above me. But there was also a rather worrying smell of burning. And when I looked down, what I saw was even more worrying.<br />
There had been, it seemed, less new building in London between 1894 and 1944 than there had been between 1844 and 1894. The place looked quite familiar. Except for one thing: many of the buildings seemed to have been squashed by something enormous falling on them, or burned out by fires. It was an extraordinary scene. You will have heard of the Great Fire of London, Rat?&quot;<br />
I had indeed. It had burned out much of the city and killed almost the entire rat population. It was a fearsome legend among rats. We feared fire more than anything.<br />
&ldquo;Well, it was not like that at all, because many buildings were quite undamaged. You would have six houses standing, then two completely collapsed, then another three standing, then a great burning fire ... I could not begin to imagine what had caused this patchwork catastrophe.<br />
I decided to go down to my garden, to see how things were there. Everything seemed fine. The house at the top of the garden was there, almost unchanged. The garden had changed in that the lawn and flower beds had been replaced by vegetable patches. Potatoes and turnips were growing, and strawberries. There were plenty of worms. It was rather nice. But there was still that worrying smell of smoke.<br />
I drove into the Effra, then upstream for a bit. I could see a ruined building, not far from the river. I drove cautiously towards it, through some long grass, parked my car somewhere safe (in a tussock by a wall), and went to explore.<br />
The ruined building had been a big house, it seemed, with many bedrooms. The centre of it had completely collapsed. But there were still bits of floor sticking out of the back walls, with a toilet here, and a chair there, oddly perched, and in the centre of the ruined house, a great pile of rubble. Cookers, bits of furniture, everything humans use, in a heap with bricks and slates from the roof and half-burned timbers. And it was so quiet. Very strange. A few humans were walking past or standing and looking, but no one was saying much, and there was no traffic.<br />
But the quiet did not last. After a few minutes, I heard a noise from overhead. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like a plane.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What is a plane?&rdquo; I enquired.<br />
&quot;Ah yes ... well, they have not yet been invented ... they are machines made by humans that, like my car, can fly in the air. They have wings and loud engines. They are often very big, big enough to carry many humans. I know them well. But this noise sounded more like a huge lazy buzzing beetle than a plane. I looked up. There it was &ndash; it looked like a tiny plane with straight wings, much too small for a human to fly in. What could it be?<br />
All the humans around looked up. They made worried noises.<br />
Then, quite suddenly, the buzzing stopped. At that, all the humans ran away, clearly in a great panic, looking for shelter. I could see why, or thought I could: the little plane&rsquo;s engine had stopped, and it was going to crash into the ground. If it landed on you, it would squash you. I thought that was what they were frightened of.<br />
I was wrong.<br />
The little plane did indeed come down, but I could see it was going to land at least a hundred yards away from me, so I didn&rsquo;t worry. I should have done.<br />
When it landed, there was a tremendous flash of light, followed by the loudest bang I have ever heard, a terrifying wind, and a blast of heat. It was a huge explosion. The little plane was one big bomb. It must have destroyed a building I couldn&rsquo;t see. Not long after the blast, a vile cloud of dust came over and settled on everything, choking me. Many bits of flying rubble settled around me. I was lucky that none of them hit me. Some of them ended up in my car. I should have closed that window.<br />
Well, you can guess what I did next. I now knew what had caused all those buildings to collapse: bombs dropping from the sky. I wasn&rsquo;t going to wait for any more &ndash; especially since I distinctly heard another lazy buzzing sound like a giant beetle, in the sky to the south, gradually getting louder. Time to go, I thought. I ran back to my car, climbed in, and headed for the Thames. I thought that no bombs would land in the river, and if they did, there would be nothing for them to destroy, so I would be safer there. I didn&#39;t try to go home. I followed the river up to Maidenhead. I saw that outside London, there were few ruined buildings. The bombs had been targeted on London. When I got to Maidenhead, I turned on the time-travelling mode. I was a bit worried about the controls because there was quite a lot of dust in the works and a few pieces of brick where they were not wanted. But I got here, as you see, Rat, and I don&#39;t think there is any serious damage to my car.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;You were lucky.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I was lucky.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Do you not think, dear Sam, that for safety&rsquo;s sake you had better limit your time-travelling? The further into the future you go, the worse things seem to be.&rdquo;<br />
He did not answer. The sound of the dinner-gong drifted over from the house.<br />
&ldquo;Rat,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, and you are so good at providing tea.&rdquo; I duly provided it. He fetched the fish from the little pond. We ate without talking much, except about what we could see, hear, and smell from where we sat, between my burrow and the river. &quot;East, West, home&#39;s best,&quot; I said, when we had finished, and the sun had gone down. &quot;I can see what makes you say that,&quot; said Sam. &quot;Still, a shrew and his car are driven by curiosity and a thirst for adventure.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Chapter 5: Too Clean</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;After we had eaten, Sam seemed unusually quiet. We sat in our deckchairs and watched the river for longer than one normally does. Stars and moon were twinkling on its choppy surface quite prettily, but one does generally tire quite fast of simply contemplating such prettiness. I wondered what Sam was thinking about, but it would have felt rude to ask.<br />
His small clear voice emerged in the darkness. &quot;Rat, who else lives in your garden?&quot; &quot;No one much,&quot; I replied. &quot;There&#39;s a common shrew in the little patch of lawn by the shrubbery and a family of mice in the hedge near the kitchen. No other creatures live at this end, by the water. Long ago there was an otter holt by that poplar tree, but the otters were hunted by dogs, which they understandably did not like, so they left.&quot; &quot;Did the dogs chase you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Never,&quot; I said. &quot;The owners of this house have never kept hunting dogs. The dogs that chased the otters live miles away; they were brought here especially to hunt the otters, and they never bothered with any other creatures.&quot;<br />
I wondered why he asked. I guessed. But I did not like to voice my guess.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Sam, &quot;I&#39;ll be off home, I suppose. I need to do some cleaning and tidying. Of my car and my thoughts. And then &ndash; tomorrow, it&#39;s 1994.&quot; I knew there was no point trying to persuade him not to go, so I simply wished him a pleasant journey and a good night and promised to be in my burrow, with my whiskers poking out and a good meal prepared, when the dinner gong went on the morrow.<br />
He opened the door of his car, removed a few pieces of brick, dusted off his seat, climbed in, drove down and into the river, and left. His car swam along the river like a duck, rather than flying over it like a kingfisher, as it usually did. I was not sure why.<br />
I went to bed and slept rather fitfully. The next day, without explaining to myself exactly why I did so, I spent tunnelling. I made a network of shallow burrows under the roots of the poplar tree, near where the otters used to live. The roots held the soil well. My tunnels were firm and neat. They led to some rather fine nest chambers, and two of them had entrances in the river-bank, one just at normal river level, one slightly higher.<br />
When I had finished, I dived out of the latter, to see whether it made a good entry point into the water. It did. But I was rather startled, as I swam back towards my burrow, by the dimness of the light. Could sunset be approaching already? It was! I had been working all day and had not felt the passage of time. I would have to be quick if I was to fulfil my promise to Sam.<br />
I quickly tossed together some pignut sandwiches, fetched up a minnow or two, then dashed back to my burrow, and stuck my backside into it. Not a moment too soon! The gong went, and at the same moment, Sam&#39;s car appeared, swimming back up the river, the way it had left the night before. It looked rather lovely, blue against the river&rsquo;s grey.<br />
I watched as it drove up through the grass. On its roof, there was no black soot and no beige dust. It seemed quite clean. Sam looked clean too when he climbed out. Clean &ndash; but subdued.<br />
&quot;Hello, Sam!&quot; I said. &quot;Hello, Rat,&quot; he replied. I fetched dinner. We ate in silence. Then Sam observed: &quot;Fine pignuts. Do they grow in your garden?&quot; &quot;They do,&quot; I said. &quot;Over there by the plum trees. Very tasty.&quot; &quot;I like plums,&quot; said Sam.<br />
I waited. Then, at last, in his own time, Sam told his story.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">1994</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;&quot;Well, I got home last night and cleaned out my car. But it hardly felt worth it, because honestly, Rat, my poor dear old home by the Effra is getting stinkier every day. The air seems to be heavy with dirt. It tires me. I was quite pleased to leave the next day.<br />
I put on my headband and set sail for May 1994. When I arrived, my first feeling was of relief. There was no filthy smog. Nor was there a stench of sewage. The sewer system was still working, thank goodness. And there were far fewer chimneys belching smoke. There were still chimneys, but out of them came only steam, mostly, and some whitish smoke. The trains produced no smoke at all. There were an awful lot of cars and buses, so many that the streets seemed quite choked with them, and their engines did make a rather unpleasant, acid sort of smell that hung in the air and irritated the lungs. But it was nothing like as bad as 1894. I thought that on the whole, things had improved, in the air of London.<br />
I wasn&#39;t so sure the buildings of London had improved. There were a lot of new ones. I thought many of them must have been replacements for those destroyed by the horrid flying bombs of 1944. Certainly, there were no collapsed buildings to be seen. London was more densely built-up than ever. But many of the new houses were rather nasty. Very plain, rectangular blocks, with none of the nooks and crannies that we small creatures like so much. The number of nice little gardens had diminished worryingly, and there were hardly any patches of waste ground.<br />
There were not many gardens left going down to the Effra. But I was delighted to see that one of the few remaining ones was mine! The old house was still there, too, looking truly ancient and wonderfully characterful among the new plain lumps that had been constructed all around it. The potatoes and turnips of 1944 had vanished. In their place was a neat garden, with a lawn, carefully planned flowerbeds, and a pond. The lawn sloped down to the water. I explored, and under it, I found my dear old tunnel network, almost intact after a century and a half. I was impressed by my engineering.<br />
But somehow, it didn&rsquo;t smell right.<br />
It seemed ... how can I put it ... too clean. There were not enough maggots and not enough worms. I wondered why.<br />
I went into the river and had much the same feeling. It wasn&#39;t murky or stinky, but it did smell odd, and there was hardly a living creature in it. Where were the minnows? Where were the mayflies that should have been dangling above the surface of the water? And the dancing midges? And the dragonflies and damselflies that should have been chasing them? I realised that there was a sound missing, too: the buzzing of bees, and indeed of flies. There simply wasn&rsquo;t enough life around.<br />
I went to look at the pond. The water was quite clean, but there was absolutely nothing living in it. This seemed particularly strange, because, you know, Rat, when humans put ponds in their gardens, it&rsquo;s usually because they want to keep ornamental fish in them. But there were no fish in this pond. Why?<br />
Somehow, the grass in the lawn felt as strange as the water in the pond. Too clean. There was no clover, there were no daisies, no moss, no dandelions; just grass, all the same kind, all the same length, and nothing living in it. No mice, no slugs or snails, hardly any ants, even. The frogs who always used to live in the bushes by the river had gone.<br />
The people who now lived in the house liked things clean and neat. But how had they managed to make the lawn into something like a carpet? Had they removed every single weed by hand? It didn&#39;t seem plausible. It occurred to me that I might investigate the garden shed. That might give me a clue.<br />
The shed was large. Its door was shut, but there was an open skylight. I hopped into my car and flew in.<br />
Inside it was light and airy. There were the usual garden tools tidily organised in a rack by the door: spade, rake, forks, trowels, hoe, and various things for clipping. There were lots of little trays with small plants growing rather perfectly and weedlessly in strange even black soil. There were gadgets in boxes whose purpose was not obvious to me. But what surprised me were the endless shelves with rows of boxes and bottles. I wondered what was in them. I hovered by the shelves and did my best to read. The print was small, but then water shrews are small too.<br />
Frankly, Rat, it was creepy. Out of four shelves, one contained various kinds of fertiliser for helping plants to grow. Fair enough. But the other three ... everything there was for killing something. There was &quot;Greener Grass&quot; which was a big dispenser full of pellets which killed all plants in your lawn apart from the grass. There was &quot;Root-Out&quot; which claimed to kill the roots of any tree, There was &quot;Perfect Path&quot;, which killed every known kind of plant. There was &quot;Do it by leaf&quot;, which was a poison you could paint on the leaf of any plant and that would kill the plant. There was rat poison and mouse poison. There was stuff to kill greenfly, woodlice, wasps, mildew ... there was even a spray to get rid of cats. Well, that certainly explained why the garden looked so clean and neat. The people in the house were in the habit of killing anything they hadn&#39;t invited into their garden.<br />
But what made me uneasy was this. In the small print for most of these poisons, there were instructions for use that included warnings. And in a lot of the warnings, it said that the substance was poisonous for aquatic life. Even if what it was designed to kill was insects or trees, it would also kill fish and frogs.<br />
No wonder the pond was empty. No wonder there were no little fish or frogs in the Effra. I shuddered. I tried to imagine myself living in my old burrow and going swimming in my old river. I couldn&rsquo;t. What would be the point of swimming in a river like that, with no fish to catch? And what if shrews counted as aquatic life? Whatever was making that water so clear might poison me too.<br />
I left.<br />
I went back home to 1844.<br />
The Effra was stinky and brown again. That was better than clear and clean and lifeless and poisoned. I had a bit of a swim and found a fish or two and a couple of tadpoles to eat.<br />
But I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking, dear Rat, of the delicious teas you make for me, with the lovely fish in your little pond, fished from the river that was neither too clean nor too dirty but just right.<br />
And so here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear Sam,&rdquo; I replied, after we had spent a few moments not speaking or looking at each other, but watching the leaves on the overhanging willows and poplars wave and twitch in the unsteadily gathering breeze. &quot;Yes, here you are. And here you shall stay, for tonight. I have made quarters for you which I hope you will find agreeable. The tunnels will probably be rather wider than you would like or are used to, having been made by a stout rat rather than a slim water shrew. But they were made with love.&quot;<br />
He did not answer. I knew what he was thinking, though, and replied to the reservation he had not expressed.<br />
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be abandoning your ancestral burrow by the Effra,&rdquo; I assured him. &ldquo;You have not finished your time travels. We both know that. One day, you will find your time. Perhaps in the past if not in the future.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And one day, kind Rat, when the time is right, you will come and visit me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I accept your invitation. I will stay the night. Show me round my new abode. And tomorrow &ndash; I will see what 2044 has in store.&rdquo;<br />
