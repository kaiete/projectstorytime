<h1>The Tale of the Baby Hedgehog</h1>
<p>Once upon a day, there was a baby hedgehog. <br>Now this hedgehog was not an ordinary hedgehog, because her name was Michelle. And also she had no spikes.<br>
This made Michelle scared. She couldn't defend herself!<br>
So she decided to make herself some defence.<br>She went to her mother and said in her little squeaky hedgehog voice: "mummy, please can I have a packed lunch? I want to go on an Expotition"<br>
Her mum replied "OK Michelle, but be careful!" So she set out on her mission.<br>
<hr>
<br>
In the garden, she found a holly bush.<br> Now, as you know, holly bushes are spiky things. So she jumped and jumped to try and get some spikes, but she just couldn't reach!<br> "Oh well," thought Michelle, and walked along to the next bush. It happened to be not a bush, but a magnolia tree.<br> Magnolia trees are not spiky.<br> So she went onto the next bush. It was a bramble bush.
"hooray! I have found the perfect spiky bush" said Michelle to herself. So she pulled off a thorn, got some glue and stuck it on her back.<br>It felt good, so she did it again. And again. And again.<br>And soon her back was covered in spikes! So she ate her lunch, and went back home.<br>
When she got home, her mother said "Who is that? It certainly can't be Michelle, for she has no spikes."<br>
"I am Michelle!" exclaimed Michelle, and she took off her spikes to prove it.<br>
Her mother jumped in surprise. "YIPPEE! You have spikes!!!"<br>
