Ok so you might think “Going to the forest is not unordinary” but it was foggy and they got lost and saw a wolf very hurt Alicorns are VERY scared of wolves but this was not your ordinary wolf it was a moon wolf a very endangered species pretty recently and Uni was TERRIFIED he hid behind a tree while Syphro and Titan helped this wolf the wolf said she was Iniue and was badly hurt from a attack from a enemy pack and hid and got lost so the 3 friends helped her get out of the forest until Syphro realised they were lost too…</span></p>

They were going to camp in the woods so they set up camp and Uni Wandered around and saw a Giant stone with markings and it told a legend before Uni Read it he yelled “Guys!

So he bowed down instead and asked if they knew any of the other souls but they said no they only know that the spirit, light, magic and the moon soul and the queen, Eleanor stepped into the throne room. Urtak and Eleanor were both Giant black bears and Eleanor was shocked too they went into a dark room and then there were runes everywhere Eleanor claimed “the runes keep out bad spirits and this is a room to protect you when the dark souls arrive to haunt the world.</span></p>
