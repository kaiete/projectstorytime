## StoryTime Privacy Policy
##### Part 1
> StoryTime never, ever sells your data to others.

All personal info is processed client side, which means that it is physically *impossible* for StoryTime to see your data.

##### StoryTime AI
> Similar to part 1

StoryTime AI also never gives your data to others, but StoryTime AI uses the Google Assistant for which you need to take a look at the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)
